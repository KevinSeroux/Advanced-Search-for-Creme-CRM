Advanced Search for Crème is a module for Crème CRM 1.4.
http://www.cremecrm.com/

It enables to search properties among a list of entities. It provides an advanced search page acessible from the left menu and the possibility to create a property from the quick creation module at the top of Creme pages.


REMARK AND CONCLUSION OF THE PROJECT:

The source code views.h is widely inspired from creme/creme_core/views/search.py.
And It was difficult to understand some bits of code such as the interaction with the Searcher class. That's why, I try to explain how the search works with comments in my code... if it can help others to also contribute to Creme.


INSTALL:

1. You have to move the opportunity_number folder into the creme folder which contains all the others modules such as activesync, activites, ...

2 - Add the module 'creme.advanced_search' into the INSTALLED_CREME_APPS tuple in your settings file (local_setting.py).

8 - The module is ready, you can now launch Crème.


TROUBLESHOOTINGS:
- It's possible you get very bad performance when you proceed to an advanced search. I will do my best to improve that.
